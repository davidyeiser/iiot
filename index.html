<h1>IIoT Product Catalog</h1>
  <div>A list of products containing communication or information models that help automate integration.</div>
  <div>A couple rules:
    <ol>
      <li>No products are allowed that are OPC-UA Data Access without any further “advanced” OPC UA features. Despite Data Access having wide adoption and providing a level of data readability, this benefit isn't significantly better than many fieldbus protocols.</li>
      <li>No products are allowed that are plain MQTT without using While MQTT allows data to be transported in a scalable way, this benefit is offset by the manual integration required to parse out the data model.</li>
    </ol>
