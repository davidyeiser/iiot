    <h1>Public IIoT Catalog</h1>
    <h2>A list of industrial products that help automate integration.</h2>
    <div>Minimum Criteria for Product Submissions:
      <ol>
        <li>Submitted product must have public literature accessable without registration that validates the information submitted.</li>
        <li>Product must support a well-known information scheme, as listed in the submission form.  If your information scheme is not included in the selection list, select "other" and enter the missing scheme for consideration.</li>
        <li>Product must support a well-known communication protocol, as listed in the submission form.  If your communicaiton protocol is not included in the selection list, select "other" and enter the missing protocol for consideration.</li>
        <li>Supporting <a href="https://reference.opcfoundation.org/v105/Core/docs/Part8/4/">OPC-UA Data Access</a> alone is not sufficient. Despite Data Access having wide adoption and providing a level of data readability, this benefit does not provide sufficient automation of integration.</li>
        <li>Supporting MQTT alone is not sufficient. While MQTT automation integration by transporting data in a scalable way, this benefit is offset by the manual integration required to parse out custom information models when not using a well-known encoding and information scheme.</li>
      </ol>
